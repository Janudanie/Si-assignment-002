# Si-assignment-002
Banks collect data about their customers, services, and transactions. The data comes in
various formats from different sources and platforms, such as mobile and web apps, ATP
machines, shops, but after some processing, it is stored permanently in SQL databases.

Your task is to create
- a server application that can open, read, and process banking data in text format and
store it in a database,
- a client application, which provides the source data in files and receives a report
about the current size of the database.
The applications should illustrate the use of RPC.
You can choose
• the business case (what kind of data is collected)
• the format of the collected data: txt, csv, html, xml, or json
• the type of the SQL database




# What is done
The client can send a user creation request to the server, through an RMI call, i can also request the size of the database.

# Problems
I dont know what the purpose of the files mentioned comes in. I'll have to talk to my Teacher about the assignment
